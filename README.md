# Health-Insurance-Cross-Sell-Prediction

#### Context
#### Our client is an Insurance company, wants to increase its insurance sales by providing health insurance to the current auto insurance holder. They have some past data about demographics (gender, age, region code), Vehicles (Vehicle Age, Damage), Policty (Premium, sourcing channel), and their response to hold auto insurance. Based, on this data we need to create a model, that will predict customers will be willing to participate in purchasing health insurance in future. This project will visualize the provided data, create an algorithm that best represnt the data, and test the model in the test data.
